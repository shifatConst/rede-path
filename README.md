# Ride Path

Ride path is a front-end based web application. Where I tried to implement some basic features of ride sharing applications like Uber.
Here you will see some available rides on the home page. If you click any of the rides it will take you another page where you can put the pick up location and destination location.
Here I implemented registration feature with firebase. You have to register and login to use the ride features.

Technologies I used here are: React, Bootstrap, ReactRouter, Firebase and Google map.
